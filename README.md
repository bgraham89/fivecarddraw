# fivecarddraw

This a five card draw (poker variant) game engine. The engine so far has been created using python, and the main game file is [fivecarddraw.py](fivecarddraw.py).

The game is currently playable; and is one-player, text-based, and uses a simple AI. The plan is to upgrade all of these features, and to learn the details required for each, as time allows.

For more details of how things have been implemented, check out the [docs](docs) folder of this repository.
