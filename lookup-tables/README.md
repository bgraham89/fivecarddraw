# Lookup Tables

This folder contains information that is used to populate some memos in the ```Dealer``` class upon initialisation. The memos essentially store a numerical score for each possible poker hand, which provides a mechanism to rank players hands, efficiently. The lookup tables themselves are stored in tsv format.

## Special Thanks

A special thanks should go to [Kevin Suffecool](https://suffe.cool/) for his exploration of the combinatorics of poker. The data contained in this folder was scraped from this page:
