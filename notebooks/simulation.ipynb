The actions they decide on may increase the amount of chips in the pot, and lower their own chipcount, but it will always set atleast one of their own status attribute to true. More aggressive actions can turn other players status attributes to false; for example a raise sets every other player.has_mincalled to false. Eventually every player will have one status attribute on, either by passive actions taken by everybody, or players running out of chips and being forced to choose passive actions.
