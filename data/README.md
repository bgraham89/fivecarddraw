# Data

This folder contains information that is used to populate some memos in the ```HandTracker``` class upon initialisation. The memos essentially store a numerical score for each possible poker hand, which provides a mechanism to rank players hands, efficiently. More info can be found in [hand.ipynb](../docs/hand.ipynb) notebook.

## Special Thanks

A special thanks should go to [Kevin Suffecool](https://suffe.cool/) for his exploration of the combinatorics of poker. The data contained in this folder was scraped from this page:
